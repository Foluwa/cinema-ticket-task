# Javascript Coding Exercise
 
## Business Rules

- There are 3 types of tickets: **Infant**, **Child**, and **Adult**.
- The ticket prices are based on the type of ticket (see table below).
- The ticket purchaser declares how many and what type of tickets they want to buy.
- Multiple tickets can be purchased at any given time.
- Only a maximum of **25 tickets** can be purchased at a time.
- **Infants** do not pay for a ticket and are not allocated a seat. They will be sitting on an Adult's lap.
- **Child** and **Infant** tickets cannot be purchased without purchasing an **Adult** ticket.

| Ticket Type | Price |
| ----------- | ----- |
| INFANT      | £0    |
| CHILD       | £15   |
| ADULT       | £25   |

- There is an existing `TicketPaymentService` responsible for taking payments.
- There is an existing `SeatReservationService` responsible for reserving seats.

## Constraints

- The `TicketService` interface **CANNOT** be modified.
- The code in the `thirdparty` packages **CANNOT** be modified.
- The `TicketTypeRequest` **MUST** be an immutable object.

## Assumptions

You can assume:

- All accounts with an `id` greater than zero are valid. They also have sufficient funds to pay for any number of tickets.
- The `TicketPaymentService` implementation is an external provider with no defects. You do not need to worry about how the actual payment happens.
- The payment will always go through once a payment request has been made to the `TicketPaymentService`.
- The `SeatReservationService` implementation is an external provider with no defects. You do not need to worry about how the seat reservation algorithm works.
- The seat will always be reserved once a reservation request has been made to the `SeatReservationService`.

## Your Task

Provide a working implementation of a `TicketService` that:

- Considers the above objective, business rules, constraints, and assumptions.
- Calculates the correct amount for the requested tickets and makes a payment request to the `TicketPaymentService`.
- Calculates the correct number of seats to reserve and makes a seat reservation request to the `SeatReservationService`.
- Rejects any invalid ticket purchase requests. It is up to you to identify what should be deemed as an invalid purchase request.
